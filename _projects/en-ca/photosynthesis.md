Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes for sustaining life on Earth and has transformed Earth
over the course of its history. Although crucial for understanding how we got to the Earth we know today,
how phototrophy operated on the early Earth and contributed to global change remains elusive. Along with "molecular
fossils" in the rock record, studying information preserved in currently living photosynthetic organisms can give crucial
new clues to understanding ancient photosynthesis. Beyond well-studied phototroph groups like crown cyanobacteria, diverse
bacterial phototrophs are now known that, although challenging to culture in the lab, perform phototrophy using unique
mechanisms that can inform our understanding of the history of phototrophy. Probing the physiology of these poorly studied
phototrophs can also yield a treasure trove of information about how photosynthesis functions, with potential applications
in biotechnology and green energy.

A major theme of my research is to explore the physiological basis of phototrophy in these lesser-known bacterial phototrophs,
with implications for understanding what ancient phototrophs were like and how they contributed to early ecosystems. My
work has centered on phototrophs that perform a particularly poorly studied metabolism known as photoferrotrophy, where
bacteria use light energy to oxidize iron as an electron source. Although only a few bacterial isolates are known to
perform photoferrotrophy on the modern Earth, it's thought that this process could represent one of the earliest
phototrophic metabolisms and was crucial to the success of phototrophs in the iron-rich oceans of the early Earth.
Huge Banded Iron Formations can be found on the modern Earth that are dated to the Archaean Eon (approx. 2.5-3.8 billion
years ago) and are full of oxidized iron minerals -- could these record the activity of ancient ecosystems, driven in part by
photoferrotrophic activity? Searching for novel photoferrotrophic bacteria on the modern Earth and probing their physiology
is one way to refine our understanding of the role of this mysterious group of phototrophs in the history of Earth.
Moreover, if newly identified photoferrotrophic bacteria are highly novel, they can expand our understanding of how
photosynthesis operates at a molecular level.

My work has identified the genomic potential for photoferrotrophy, driven by novel members of the *Chlorobia* class, in
iron-rich Boreal Shield lakes
and has resulted in the enrichment of a novel species that could potentially be induced to perform iron oxidation, based
on its genome, in future work (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0725-0'>Tsuji <i>et al.</i>, ISME J, 2020</a>;
<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46708'>Schiff <i>et al.</i>, Sci Rep, 2017</a>).
Moreover, probing for photoferrotrophs led us to grow a highly unusual phototroph, named "<i>Candidatus</i> Chlorohelix
allophototropha" (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.190934'>Tsuji <i>et al.</i>, bioRxiv, 2023</a>), that
encodes a novel clade of Type I photosynthetic reaction center protein and has major implications for our understanding
of the diversity and evolution of photosynthesis. In future, I plan to examine the physiology and metabolism of
"<i>Ca.</i> Chlorohelix allophototropha" in more detail, along with the implications of discovery of this
unsuual strain for the history of photosynthesis on Earth. I'm very excited for our upcoming work in this area.
