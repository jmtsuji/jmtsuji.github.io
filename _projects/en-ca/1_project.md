Conditions on the surface of the ancient Earth are thought to have been drastically different than they are today.
In the Archaean Eon of Earth's history (approximately 3.8-2.5 billion years ago), starting from when the planet was cool
enough to support liquid water, the Earth's surface was likely devoid of molecular oxygen and was overlain by an
atmosphere rich (by today's standards) in carbon dioxide and methane. The oceans for much of the Archaean Eon were rich
in dissolved, ferrous iron based on modern rock records, and were poor in sulfate and sulfide -- quite different from
the sulfate-rich and oxygenated oceans of today. This early period of Earth's history is presumably when life would have
arisen and early microbial metabolisms key to modern nutrient cycling would have arisen -- things like photosynthesis,
nitrogen fixation, and carbon and iron metabolisms. Early microbial ecosystems must have eventually exploited the open
ocean, rich in iron -- but how did these communities function? How did their anoxic and reducing ecosystem influence
their evolution? And how did they, likewise, shape the conditions of the Earth? One limit to our ability to answer such
questions comes from the fact that the surface of the modern Earth is drastically different than that of the early
planet. Microbes and marco-scale life (like us) have adapted to cope with and take advantage of the high levels of
molecular oxygen in the atmosphere, and aquatic environments like the ancient ocean are hard to find. As such, it's
hard to test hypotheses of how ancient life may have functioned at an ecosystem scale, given the rarity of analogous
modern environments, and it's hard to seek out microorgansims that may have retained some of the traits crucial to
the success of early life.

In my research, we seek out novel ecosystems that be used as analogues of ancient Earth oceans and probe these systems
for the unusual microbial life that they contain. Much of my graduate work focused on iron-rich Boreal Shield lakes at
the <a href='http://iisd.org/ela/'>International Institute for Sustainable Development Experimental Lakes Area
(IISD-ELA; Ontario, Canada)</a>. We explored whether seasonally anoxic Boreal Shield lakes (that only develop
O<sub>2</sub>-free waters for part of each year, followed by seasonal mixing) could serve as a unique type of Archaean
ocean analogue that, although not stably anoxic, are far more abundant globally than any other class of iron-rich and
anoxic aquatic system currently known. We showed that these lakes can develop anaerobic microbial communities upon
anoxia that are robust against seasonal mixing (Schiff *et al*., Sci Rep, 2017) and that these lakes harbour
anoxygenic phototrophs in the *Chlorobia* class that have the genomic potential for iron oxidation, a poorly studied
processes within this group that may have been highly relevant on ancient Earth (Tsuji *et al*., ISME J, 2020). We are
continuing to sample diverse aquatic environments that can potentially serve as early Earth ocean analogues (leading to
some great field work experiences!), and we are studying the microorganisms in these environments using a combination of
environmental DNA/RNA sequencing and enrichment cultivation of key microorganisms in the lab. This work is shedding new
light on poorly understood microbial metabolisms that could have helped shape the course of Earth's history and is
giving us a new window into the vast microbial diversity on our modern planet.
