As a Young Research Fellow at the <a href='https://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/'>Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and
Technology (JAMSTEC)</a>, I'm thrilled to be able to study how life and Earth have co-evolved through the activity of
microorganisms. Although too small to see with the naked eye, microorganisms have been one of the most powerful agents
of natural global change over Earth's history and continue to have a profound effect on our oceans, atmosphere, and
ecosystem services. I study modern microorganisms to try to unravel how their ancestors participated in large-scale
global change, with relevance to understanding both "how we got here" to the Earth we know today and microbial factors
that can continue to shape our planet. My focus lies especially on understanding the history and ancestry of
photosynthesis, one of the most important biological processes today for sustaining life. I delve into diverse aquatic
environments to probe microbial phototrophs and their partners for signals of how these organisms have evolved and
adapted over the course of geologic time.

Check out the <a href='/projects'>Research</a> tab to see the active research themes I'm exploring. I also have a
<a href='/blog'>newly made blog</a> I hope to update from time to time with thoughts about experiments, code, or other things
related to microbial ecology.
